<!--Variables is like a container where we can store strings and numbers to run in the console...we can use VAR, Let or CONST to run a variable, however LET and VAR are only used if the variable can be changed at some point whereas,CONST which means "constant", can be used when we do not have any plans of changing the strings or numbers stored in the variable."-->

<!--There are various naming conventions used in variables, however not all can be used in Javascript, some of the nameing conventions are: 
(1), CAMEL CASE: this convention starts with a small letter, followed by an uppercase at beginning of every other word. e.g (cartQuantity) 

(2), PASCAL CASE: similer with camel case but in this convention, the first letter of everyword is written in uppercase e.g: (CartQuantity)

(3), KADEB CASE: this convention is not used in javascript. it is hoverever used in other cases to name our files and folders. it is written with a dash (-) after each word, whereas everything remains in lower case e.g (cart-quantity).

(4), SNAKE CASE: this naming convention comes with an underscore after each word, it is not used in javascript too. e.g: (cart_quantity), where every other letter remains in lowercase.
